## 🔧 **Salesforce MVC Architecture Explained**

### 🔄 What is MVC?

**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a **design pattern** that separates an application into three main logical components:

* **Model** – Data layer
* **View** – UI layer
* **Controller** – Business logic

* * *

### 📦 **MVC in Salesforce (SFDC)**

|Layer	|Description	|Salesforce Examples	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|**Model**	|Represents the **data and schema**	|sObjects, Custom Objects, Fields, Relationships	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|**View**	|Represents the **UI (how data is presented to users)**	|Visualforce Pages, Page Layouts, Tabs	|
|**Controller**	|Contains the **business logic** that handles user input and interactions	|Apex Classes, Triggers, Workflows, Standard/Custom Controllers	|

* * *

### 🧱 **Details by Component**

#### 📘 **Model (Database Layer)**

* Represents application data.
* In Salesforce, each **object (sObject)** represents a model.
* Examples: `Account`, `Contact`, `CustomObject__c`

#### 🖥️ **View (User Interface Layer)**

* Responsible for presenting data to the user.
* Built using:
    * **Visualforce Pages**
    * **Lightning Components (in LWC)** *(extends MVC into MVVM)*
    * **Page Layouts and Tabs**

#### 🧠 **Controller (Business Logic Layer)**

* Handles interactions and executes actions on user input.
* Can be:
    * **Standard Controllers**
    * **Custom Controllers / Extensions** (written in Apex)
    * **Workflows, Apex Triggers, Processes**

* * *

### ✅ **Benefits of MVC Architecture in Salesforce**

|Benefit	|Explanation	|
|---	|---	|
|**Separation of Concerns**	|Each layer is independent, making changes in one layer not affect others.	|
|---	|---	|
|**High Reusability**	|Multiple views (UI layouts) can use the same business logic.	|
|**Improved Maintenance**	|Easier to test, debug, and maintain due to modular structure.	|
|**Faster Development**	|Teams can work in parallel (UI vs Logic), reducing development lifecycle.	|
|**Enhanced Scalability**	|Code is better organized, making it easier to scale the application.	|

* * *

## ❗ **Salesforce Misconceptions: Clarified**

### 🔧 **Data Modeling Misconceptions**

**1. Can many-to-many relationships only be created using Master-Detail Relationships?**
**❌ No.**

* Many-to-many relationships can be built using either **Master-Detail** or **Lookup relationships**.
* However, when **both parent relationships are Master-Detail**, the intermediate object is referred to as a **Junction Object**.
* If either or both are Lookups, it still technically supports many-to-many, just without roll-up summary or strict ownership control.

**2. Is the Recycle Bin available only in Salesforce Classic?**
**❌ No.**

* In **Lightning Experience**, the Recycle Bin is also available.
* Access it by going to **App Launcher (9 dots)** → Search **“Recycle Bin”** → Open it.

* * *

### 🔐 **Data Security Misconceptions**

**3. Can we assign “View All” and “Modify All” to any profile for any object?**
**✅ Technically Yes, but ❗use with caution.**

* These are **powerful administrative overrides**.
* Granting **“View All”** allows users to **see all records** of that object, **ignoring sharing rules**.
* Granting **“Modify All”** lets them **edit/delete all records**, regardless of ownership or sharing settings.
* ⚠️ These should **only be given to trusted, admin-level profiles**. Once given, you cannot restrict access via sharing rules.
